# Introduction and Inspiration

Our group is proud to have developed The Ghost of CYM, a 2D story-based adventure game. When discussing what genre of game we wanted to build, we found that many of the games we really enjoyed are ones that involved more plotline - therefore, rather than a simple arcade-style game, we decided to take on the challenge of designing a game that follows a story - complete with a main character and villain, mysteries, and a developing plot. 

Next we needed a good story idea that could connect with HKU and its students. During each of our first weeks at the university, we were told the well-known HKU ghost story, the eerie mystery and question of whether Chong Yuet Ming’s spirit haunts the CYM building. This amenities center was built by Li Ka Shing, Hong Kong’s richest man, in honor of his late wife Chong Yuet Ming. She passed away, but because of curious things about the CYM building such as escalators that only go up, zigzagging staircases, and mysterious symbols, there are theories that it was designed to keep her spirit within. We all loved the idea, and thought we could build an interesting game with it. 

We took inspiration primarily from the game Limbo as well as the Da Vinci Code story. Limbo is a 2D puzzle adventure game that involves getting through an eerie, deserted island to find the main character’s family. Throughout the game there are mini challenges and puzzles the player must solve, such as dragging a trap to a spider’s attacking legs, in order to proceed. We liked the small challenges, frustration, and ultimate feelings of triumph these brought to the game, and wanted to incorporate something similar in our own game. Similarly the Da Vinci Code delves into history’s hidden secrets, reveals plot twists, and constantly brings excitement and thrills for the reader through its interesting storyline. It too involves the main character solving a series of puzzles in order to understand the mystery. Using Limbo and the Da Vinci Code as inspiration, we worked on our game’s story and chose to incorporate related minigames.

Without further ado, welcome to The Ghost of CYM. HKU has been evacuated and you discover it’s because the Ghost of CYM has returned. How did she get let free, and why is she so angry? That is your task, and good luck as you enter the haunted Chong Yuet Ming Amenities Center!

# Basics

Movements 

The game begins in the dingy hallways of the CYM building. You can move around the building and navigate using the left and right arrow keys. In certain levels you may have to jump, which you can do using the spacebar. 

Interaction with doors and people 

To enter and exit doors, hallways, and stairs you need to go up to the door and hit enter. To interact with people in the game, press the “i” key. 

Upper Bar

To help guide you, there will be a black bar at the top of the screen which will be the main communication channel between the game and you. It will display information such as Score, Health, and Current Task. All important instructions and hints will be displayed on this bar as well. You can always quit the game using the Quit button at the top right corner of the upper bar.

Health & Score

In the beginning of the game you are given 100 health points. You have to make sure that your health points stay above 0 points. If it reaches 0, the game ends. In certain levels you will get some powerups to boost your health. During the game you will have many chances to collect certain collectables to increase your score. You can keep a track of your score and health through the upper bar. 

# Ghostly Flooding

When you enter the CYM building you hear a women crying. You have to locate where the women is and talk to her. You realise the voice is of the janitor coming from the girls bathroom. You go and talk to the janitor. She tells you to find CYM’s necklace and fix the broken ghost seal, but before she is able to tell you more details, the lights go off and the janitor vanishes. The ghost overheard your conversation, and because she isn’t ready to be sealed again, the bathroom has been locked and the pipes suddenly burst. The water starts flooding the room and the only way to fix them is to connect the two ends and prevent any water leakage. 

How to Play

The left and right keys are disabled in this level. You have to rotate the individual pipe pieces to connect the main piece at the top left corner to the piece at the bottom right before the water fills the bathroom. To rotate a piece by 90 degrees, click on the individual piece once. You can click on a piece any number of times to get the desired rotation. Make sure that there are no leaks left in your connection. Once you fix the connection and there are no leaks, the water will retreat and you will return to the bathroom scene.

# Ghost Treasure Hunt

This is the second level of the game. You must find CYM’s jewelry box containing her necklace, which someone has hidden under the ParknShop. According to rumors, this is why the ghost is sometimes seen near ParknShop and made it close earlier than other outlets on campus. Once you find her necklace and fix the symbol, you can use the jewelry to appease CYM’s ghost. However it looks like someone deliberately wanted the ghost to be angry and HKU to be evacuated - there are enemies set up throughout the level who will hurt your health if you touch them.

How to Play    
   
Use arrow keys to move. You need to get to the lower levels and dungeon, which are blocked by a wooden crate. Find the bomb and use “b” to throw it at the crate. For additional health, you can use the bomb to kill the rat and box simultaneously. If you use up your bomb incorrectly, exit and re-enter the ParknShop to get a new bomb.
 
The jewelry box is two levels below the ParknShop. Keep descending, making sure to avoid enemies, to reach it. At the bottom, you will also find armor. If you collect it, you can attack enemies by pressing “b” to use an unlimited supply of bullets.

To return to the ParknShop level, you may use the fountains that spring you up a level.

Key Features

* Here the player has to figure out a lot of things on his own. The first thing is to hit the bomb when the enemy rat is near the box, this will make him gain health and destroy the box to go to the dungeon.
* Also, on the second layer, the player has to figure out that there is a path that the enemy is blocking, and he needs to jump over the enemy and go down. Touching the enemy will reduce his health.
* On the last depth, player gets attacked by bullets from random directions and there will be enemies appearing once the player has collected the jewelry box.

# Ghost Stair Chase

After retrieving CYM's beloved necklace, the next step is to check out the supposed ghost seal on the second floor. However, the escalators stopped working and you're faced with the strange, zigzagging staircases of the building. This is the Ghost Stair Chase level.

How to Play

The goal of this level is to reach the end of the maze-like staircases. There will also be coins you can collect to increase your score. Use the arrow keys to move, but every 5 seconds the direction each key corresponds to may change - for example you may hit the right arrow key and find yourself moving left. While being disoriented, you'll also need to watch out for CYM's ghost - though she drifts slower, she is constantly following you and can walk through the walls.

Once you reach the end at the tile with the arrow, hit Enter to exit the staircase and complete the level. 

# Ghost Seal Shootout

Now that you have reached the second hallway upstairs, you notice that the ghost seal on the wall is cracked and dulled. You see the broken pieces of the ghost seal twinkling at the end of the next hallway; however, the ghost won’t let you fix her seal easily! She fires ghostly beams and summons an army of giant rats to prevent you from getting the pieces. 

How to Play

In this Galaga style shooter, use the arrows keys to move up, down, and side-to-side as you run down the hallway. Press space to shoot your ParknShop bullets at the giant rats but be careful not to blast the symbols. The ghost will be firing deadly beams from the sides.

# Key Features 

The key feature of our game is in-depth blending of the HKU lore into gameplay. Not only are the mini-games exciting and challenging, but each also individually pays homage to the CYM ghost story that most students are familiar with, and it progresses the story throughout the game. The bathroom game references the haunted girls’ bathroom mirrors in CYM. The ParknShop game references the odd hours of the haunted CYM ParknShop. The stairs game references the strange escalators and winding stairs in the CYM ghost story. The seal game references the spooky Taoist symbols on the railings in the CYM ghost story. Having such strong references to the legendary story makes the player feel more connected and involved in the game story because it involves him in something very relatable and intimate as an HKU student.
